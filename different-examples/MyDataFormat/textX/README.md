## Data Model Grammar (MyDataFormat.tx)

This is a description of the textX grammar file named `YourGrammarName.tx`. This grammar defines a set of data structures that can be used to represent various types of information.

The grammar file itself defines the structure and syntax of the data format. It allows you to parse text files containing data in this format and convert them into a structured representation within your program.

**Using the Grammar:**

1. **Include the Grammar:**  In your program, import the grammar using `from textx import metamodel_from_str`. Then, load the grammar definition from the file using `grammar = metamodel_from_str(open('YourGrammarName.tx').read())`.

2. **Parse Data:** Use the loaded grammar with `model = grammar.model_from_str(your_data_string)` to parse a string containing data in the defined format. This will create a model object representing the parsed data structure.

3. **Access Data:** The model object provides access to the parsed data elements. You can navigate the structure using the defined attributes and methods. 

**Testing and Visualization (Optional):**

- The `textx` command-line tool can be used to generate a visual representation (dot file) of the grammar and parsed data models for visualization with tools like Graphviz. Refer to the `textx` documentation for details.

**Note:**

- While textX allows parsing various text formats, it's generally recommended to use specialized parsers for well-established formats like JSON for better performance.
