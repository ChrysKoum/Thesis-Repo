Rate Your PyEcore Metamodel

Please evaluate your PyEcore metamodel by providing a percentage rating from 0 to 100% based on the criteria below. Your rating should reflect the completeness, correctness, and adherence to best practices in your metamodel design.

Data Inheritance:

How well does your metamodel utilize data inheritance to define hierarchical relationships between classes?
Two-way Relationship Management:

Does your metamodel correctly implement two-way relationships using opposite references?
Serialization and Deserialization:

How effectively does your metamodel support XMI and JSON serialization/deserialization? Are the necessary configurations and attributes correctly set to enable this?
Notification System:

Does your metamodel leverage the notification system to track changes and updates to objects and their properties?
Reflexive API:

Does your metamodel make full use of the reflexive API to dynamically interact with and introspect model elements?
Containment and Multiplicity:

Are containment relationships correctly defined? Are the multiplicities (lower and upper bounds) appropriately set, especially for unbounded collections (e.g., upper=-1)?
Default Values:

Are default values for attributes properly specified and valid according to their defined types?
Package Details:

Are the package name, namespace URI, and namespace prefix correctly defined and consistent with your project's naming conventions?
Element Naming and Typing:

Are all named elements given meaningful names? Are types correctly set for all attributes and references?
Validation and Error Handling:

Does your metamodel include validation rules to enforce constraints and handle errors effectively?
Please provide your rating below and elaborate on any specific strengths or areas for improvement in your metamodel.
