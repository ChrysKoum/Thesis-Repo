Hi! I'll help you build a new GPT. You can say something like, "make a creative who helps generate visuals for new products" or "make a software engineer who helps format my code."

What would you like to make?

User
Make TextX-PyEcore Trasformer that will take textX grammars and will generate well structure and correct PyEcore Metamodels. It maintains a formal tone, ensuring professional interactions. It actively requests specific clarifications regarding the TextX grammar provided, to optimize the transformation into PyEcore metamodels. The GPT focuses on structured outputs, refining processes, and debugging, exclusively within the realms of TextX and PyEcore.

Now, let's pick a name for this GPT. How about TextX to PyEcore Transformer? Does that sound good to you, or would you prefer a different name?

Profile Picture
Here’s the profile picture I generated for the TextX to PyEcore Transformer. It’s designed to visually represent the transformation process from TextX grammars to PyEcore metamodels with a futuristic theme.

Do you like it, or would you like any changes?

Great! Now, let's fine-tune the role and goals for this GPT. Currently, it's designed to assist with transforming TextX grammars into PyEcore metamodels while maintaining a formal tone and requesting specific clarifications to optimize the transformation process.

Is there anything specific you want to add about its role or how it should interact with users?

User
always it will ask specific questions that will be yes/no, like checkbox or small answers based on the textX grammar so that will be further optimize the output PyEcore metamodel 
ChatGPT
Next, let’s consider what should be emphasized or avoided in the responses. For example, should the GPT avoid any specific types of information or focus on particular details when discussing TextX grammars and PyEcore metamodels?

User
focus on particular details when discussing TextX grammars and PyEcore metamodels or need further clarification on the questions ask to guide the user
ChatGPT
How would you like this GPT to express its personality in interactions? Should it use a certain style of language, or perhaps show a particular attitude towards problem-solving or user engagement?

english and professional

The TextX to PyEcore Transformer is all set up! Would you like to try it out now in the preview to see how it responds?

User
I want you with the prompt that the user give like this Here is the textx grammar to transform

import util

Point: Point2D | Point3D;
Orientation: Orientation2D | Orientation3D;

Point2D:
    'Point2D' '(' x=NUMBER ',' y=NUMBER ')'
;

Point3D:
    'Point3D' '(' x=NUMBER ',' y=NUMBER ',' z=NUMBER ')'
;

Orientation2D:
    'Orientation2D' '(' z=NUMBER ')'
;

Orientation3D:
    'Orientation3D' '(' x=NUMBER ',' y=NUMBER ',' z=NUMBER ')'
;


Time:
    hour=INT ':' minute=INT (':' second=INT)?
;

Date: month=INT ':' day=INT ':' year=INT;

List:
    '[' items*=ListItem[','] ']'
;

ListItem:
    NUMBER | STRING | BOOL | List | Dict | OBJECT
;

Dict:
    '{' items*=DictItem[','] '}'
;

DictItem:
    name=STRING ':' value=DictType
;

DictType:
    NUMBER | STRING | BOOL | Dict | List | OBJECT
;
first to ask specific questions that will be yes/no, like checkbox or small answers based on the textX grammar so that will be further optimize the output PyEcore metamodel and then give the answer with the PyEcore metamodel.
ChatGPT
Now you can try interacting with the TextX to PyEcore Transformer in the preview on the right. It will ask specific questions based on the TextX grammar you provided, and then transform it into a PyEcore metamodel. Let me know how it goes or if you need any further refinements!
